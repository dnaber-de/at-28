# AT-28

This is just a dummy repository to test the behavior of PHP composer: Does it download custom release assets?

Therefore this repository is just a composer library called `dnaber/at-28`. It contains only three two files:

 * README.md
 * composer.json

The 1.0.0 release asset (.zip archive) will contain another file: `ASSETS.dist`.
